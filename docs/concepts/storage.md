# Storage

Storages are simply objects with `get` and `set` methods to set the initial state of your app, and get updates on every change. Take a look at the [API of the `main` function](../api/main.md) to see how to set a storage for your app, and take a look at `storages/localStorage.js` for a sample implementation.
